Description: smaller version of caniuse-db, with only the essentials
 caniuse-lite, is a smaller dataset of caniuse-db that keeps essential parts of
 the data in a compact format. It does this in multiple ways, such as
 converting null array entries into empty strings, representing support data as
 an integer rather than a string, and using base62 references instead of longer
 human-readable keys.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
